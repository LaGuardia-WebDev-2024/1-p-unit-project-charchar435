      <h2> Backstory</h2>
        
    
        
      <p>Growing up, I listened to many different types of music. With <strong>My dad it was 1960's,70's and 80's classic rock </strong>, and with my mom it was 70's and 80's disco, pop and soul music. When I was younger
        It was sort of against my will because what would just be what was playing. But as I got older I
        started to adopt my parents music taste and would make playlists full of the songs they played.
        more recently I discovered my own music taste. which still included those old songs, but with the 
        new addition of R&B music.<em> I develped such a love for R&B music, specifically from the 90's.</em> </p> 
        
      
      
      
      <h2>What does it mean to me?/importance</h2>
      
      <p>The reason my parents music is important to me is because it reminds me of being a child.
        It also reflects how different they are as people and how differently they grew up. R&B music 
        is important to me because it is mainly the music I like to sing. All the songs have a certain 
        similar beat and chords that I think is so addicting. It also represents me having a music taste 
        of my own.
