      <h2>What music?</h2>
        
      <p>Growing up, I listened to many different types of music. With My dad it was 1970's and 80's 
        classic rock, and with my mom it was 70's and 80's disco, pop and soul music. When I was younger
        It was sort of against my will because what would just be what was playing. But as I got older I
        started to adopt my parents music taste and would make playlists full of the songs they played.
        more recently I discovered my own music taste. which still included those old songs, but with the 
        new addition of R&B music. I develped such a love for R&B music, specifically from the 90's.</p>
